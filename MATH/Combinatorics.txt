**Catalan numbers:
The Catalan number Cn is the solution for:

.Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of n opening and n closing brackets.
.The number of rooted full binary trees with n+1 leaves (vertices are not numbered). 
A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
.The number of ways to completely parenthesize n+1 factors.
.The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with n+2 sides 
(i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
.The number of ways to connect the 2n points on a circle to form n disjoint (do no intercept) chords.
(A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on the circle. 
More generally, a chord is a line segment joining two points on any curve, for instance, an ellipse. 
A chord that passes through a circle's center point is the circle's diameter.)
//.The number of non-isomorphic full binary trees with n internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
.The number of monotonic lattice paths from point (0,0) to point (n,n) in a square lattice of size n×n, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting (0,0) to (n,n)).
//.Number of permutations of length n that can be stack sorted (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index i<j<k, such that ak<ai<aj ).
//The number of ways to cover the ladder 1…n using n rectangles (The ladder consists of n columns, where ith column has a height i).
